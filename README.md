# What is NomNomNavigator?

NomNomNavigator is a restaurant finder app that helps you decide on a restaurant in record time. 

# What does NomNomNavigator do?

When you feel hungry but don’t want to decide where to eat, let NomNomNavigator do the thinking for you. We make it so that you won’t have to decide from a long list of options.
Simply choose from a few categories and filters, such as minimum star rating, distance from your location/zip code, type of food, and voilà - you’ll be presented with an option that fits those criteria as closely as possible. Don’t like it? We’ll give you the next best fit. Like a certain restaurant or shop? We can store that for you so that you can come back to that selection whenever you want, and we’ll be sure to add those details into the future algorithms that we use to generate your next Nom!
